# Bachelor-s-thesis
This repository contains the code I have written for my Bachelor's thesis in Mathematics at the University of Trieste.
The goal of the programming part of the dissertation was to show the efficiency of Krylov's method when used to compute the matrix exponential.
All the code is written in MATLAB.
